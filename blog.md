## Biography
 
>I'm An Yu Chen, a doctoral researcher in Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy at Alliance Manchester Business School (AMBS) within the University of Manchester. At the same time, I have a research affiliation to the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research (MIoIR). 
 
>My PhD project focuses on the knowledge production of green technologies by examining the linkages between science and technology. I was also part of a research project, UK Doctoral Graduates' Contribution to Innovation, where I explored the extent of diversity and difference in science across different fields and how it impacts innovation using publication data. During this time, I developed strong skills in collecting and analyzing patent and publication data.
 
>I am particularly interested in researching the knowledge production of emerging technologies that can help address grand challenges and promote sustainability. In the meantime, I’m interested in the policy perspectives on the diffusion process and the variations between science and technology. All in all, my research has revolved around the interrelated topics of knowledge exchange and flows, the characteristics of science, and technological innovation.
 
>Prior to Manchester, I accumulated skills in programming with Python and R, and gained knowledge in social network analysis and text mining.
