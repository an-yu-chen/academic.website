I’m an academic and holistic thinker who loves addressing intricate problems. I like getting involved in academic networking event and meeting the like-minded people!

## Biography 
>I train as a doctoral researcher at at the University of Manchester's Alliance Manchester Business School, where I am interested in the knowledge production and exchange in emerging technology areas such as green technologies and AI. At the same time, I worked as a research assistant for Prof. Cornelia Lawson, where we were buidling a UK doctoral graduate database and I am interested in exploring how research and science in the UK translate into technological practices and applications  (please see: https://www.mioir.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/uk-dgci/). My work has mostly focused on the area of green technologies - where the diversity of components and uncertainties raises questions about how to better develop them through the synergy between science and technology and collaboration among various actors in research networks. I am also interested inknowledge flows and production in critical technologies such as AI and its applications.

## Research Theme Significance
>The linkages between science and technology hold significant promise for important emerging fields, such as AI and green technologies, which shape how we address grand societal challenges. I study how the interaction between science and technology manifests in emerging and green technologies and to answer questions about how science shapes green technologies within the context of the interactions and dynamics between the evolving science and technology landscapes. Along with contemporary shifts in science such as Mode 2 knowledge production, characterized by interdisciplinary research exchange and disruptive knowledge trajectories, I explore how these phenomena foster subsequent innovations. Slowly and surely, I am building the momentum for more research and projects around the nexus between science, technology and innovation policy.

## General Research interests
>My research has followed a theme of innovation and knowledge production associated with exploring complex relationships between science and technology, and their intersection with policy implications and policy making. Through research into bibliometric data such as patents and publicaitons. I have some working papers going on. For onstance, one of them is on how the use of sciendce affect the development of green technologies, which demonstrate how science affect green patents citations and impact. I like learning the craft for programming and some novel methods such as machine learning, semantic similarity.I’m passionate about sustainability in dealing with environmental changing and exploring ever changing government policy to promote green future.


## Teaching
>I had minimal teaching commitments with the Department of Computer Science at UoM in 2023 during my PhD. I worked closely with Dr. Gareth Henshall’s team to deliver courses, workshops, and labs on Database Systems. I also assisted undergraduate student groups with their projects and assignments on database design.
