  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.2rem; margin-bottom: 25px;">My Research Journey & Interests</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    As a doctoral researcher at the **University of Manchester's Alliance Manchester Business School**, my passion lies in unraveling the complex interplay between knowledge production and exchange, particularly within cutting-edge fields like **green technologies** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. I am an academic and holistic thinker, always eager to address intricate problems and engage in academic networking to connect with like-minded individuals.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Alongside my doctoral studies, I serve as a **Research Associate** for Professor Cornelia Lawson. In this role, I'm deeply involved in building a comprehensive UK doctoral graduate database, exploring how UK research and science translate into technological practices and applications. You can learn more about this initiative at: <a href="https://www.mioir.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/uk-dgci/" style="color: #6192bc;">UK DGCI</a>.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    My core research predominantly centers on green technologies—a field where diverse components and inherent uncertainties necessitate understanding how to best foster their development through synergistic efforts between science, technology, and collaborative research networks. Beyond this, I am keenly interested in knowledge flows and production in other critical areas, such as AI and its myriad applications. The linkages between science and technology hold immense promise for addressing grand societal challenges, especially in these emerging fields.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    My work delves into how these interactions manifest, specifically examining how science shapes green technologies within the dynamic landscapes of evolving scientific and technological innovation. Inspired by contemporary shifts in science, such as Mode 2 knowledge production, characterized by interdisciplinary exchange and disruptive knowledge trajectories, I explore how these phenomena drive subsequent innovations. Gradually, I am building a portfolio of research and projects at the nexus of science, technology, and innovation policy.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Through extensive research into bibliometric data, including patents and publications, I have several ongoing working papers. For instance, one explores how scientific insights drive green technology development, demonstrating science's impact on green patent citations and influence. My broader interests encompass innovation and knowledge production, exploring complex relationships between science, technology, and their policy implications. I am particularly passionate about sustainability and addressing environmental change, continually exploring evolving government policies that promote a greener future.

    <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-bottom: 25px;">Programming & Analytical Skills</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      My proficiency in data collection and analysis is primarily built upon extensive use of **R** and **Python**. I have consistently sought to enhance my skills through dedicated training, including Python courses and Bibliometrics workshops at the University of Manchester, as well as participating in RISIS (<a href="https://www.risis2.eu" style="color: #6192bc;">https://www.risis2.eu</a>) training courses, which have broadened my programming skill set considerably. A significant highlight of my learning journey was the AI4STIP winter school, where I deepened my proficiency in **Large Language Models (LLM)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I am adept at retrieving **Scopus data via APIs**, particularly using the **Pybliometrics Python API wrapper**. My interest in bibliometric data began early in my PhD, leading me to utilize the **Bibliometrix R package** in my first year to construct citation networks and trace the evolution of research articles.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Beyond specific tools, I excel at rapidly grasping new concepts and techniques. I can typically pick up a new algorithm or method within a few weeks, understanding their unique strengths and niches. This quick learning ability extends to the mathematical theory behind algorithms, allowing me to build robust data architectures and combine the right features for predictive modeling, while also being mindful of challenges like overfitting. Approximately 68% of my day-to-day work now involves advanced **data science** using libraries such as **NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, Pandas, and Matplotlib**. I am also actively pursuing further knowledge in machine learning through courses like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning specialization, ensuring I build a strategic and powerful understanding of the field.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      My core data management skills, which laid the foundation for my current expertise, include: **subsetting (filtering rows), selecting columns, sorting, adding variables, aggregating, joining, obtaining, cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing data**. In my role as a **Research Associate**, I deal with the granular daily tasks of managing data, integrating models into solutions, and deploying them effectively. I also work within **Linux VM environments** for downloading metadata via APIs and building robust databases. My work often involves drawing insights from various sources, piecing together information to form comprehensive understandings. I am a strong communicator, work well in a team, and can perform effectively under tough deadlines. I aspire to be a key contributor to research projects, aiming to publish several articles that advance our understanding.

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.2rem; margin-bottom: 25px;">Teaching Experience</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    I possess valuable experience in teaching, cultivated during my PhD studies in 2023 with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. I collaborated closely with Dr. Gareth Henshall’s team to deliver courses, workshops, and labs focused on Database Systems. My responsibilities included assisting undergraduate student groups with their projects and assignments on database design.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    To further refine my pedagogical approach, I actively participated in the **AMBS TA Professional Development Workshop series**. This comprehensive training covered essential aspects of effective teaching, including:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 25px; font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 20px auto; line-height: 1.8;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">**In the classroom:** Mastering public speaking fundamentals, effectively utilizing graphical aids and drawing, and fostering a responsive environment by encouraging and reacting to instant feedback from students.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">**After the lesson:** Providing constructive feedback to lecturers to be a highly effective Teaching Assistant, and gaining valuable tips on meeting with students outside of structured class times.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">**Leveraging TA experience for career growth:** Understanding how to best highlight my TA work in job applications, on my CV, and how to generate papers for teaching-focused conferences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    The workshops also challenged conventional assumptions about 'international students' and explored various strategies to support them. Furthermore, I learned to leverage diverse digital tools to enhance engagement in the classroom, such as **Mentimeter/Padlet** for interactive sessions, and **Slido** and **Poll Everywhere** for live activities and in-class pop quizzes, thereby fostering a dynamic and participative learning environment.
