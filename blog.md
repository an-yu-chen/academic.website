## Biography 
>I train as a doctoral researcher at at the University of Manchester's Alliance Manchester Business School, where I am interested in the knowledge production and exchange in emerging technology areas such as green technologies and AI. At the same time, I worked as a research assistant for Prof. Cornelia Lawson, where we were buidling a UK doctoral graduate database and I am interested in exploring how research and science in the UK translate into technological practices and applications  (please see: https://www.mioir.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/uk-dgci/). My work has mostly focused on the area of green technologies - where the diversity of components and uncertainties raises questions about how to better develop them through the synergy between science and technology and collaboration among various actors in research networks. I am also interested inknowledge flows and production in critical technologies such as AI and its applications



 
>My PhD project focuses on the knowledge production of green technologies by examining the linkages between science and technology. I was also part of a research project, UK Doctoral Graduates' Contribution to Innovation, where I explored the extent of diversity and difference in science across different fields and how it impacts innovation using publication data. During this time, I developed strong skills in collecting and analyzing patent and publication data.
 
>I am particularly interested in researching the knowledge production of emerging technologies that can help address grand challenges and promote sustainability. In the meantime, I’m interested in the policy perspectives on the diffusion process and the variations between science and technology. All in all, my research has revolved around the interrelated topics of knowledge exchange and flows, the characteristics of science, and technological innovation.
 
>Prior to Manchester, I accumulated skills in programming with Python and R, and gained knowledge in social network analysis and text mining.
