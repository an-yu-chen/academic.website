    <h2>PhD Research</h2>
    <p>
        My doctoral research at the University of Manchester focused on the dynamic relationship between scientific knowledge and technological innovation, particularly within the field of green technologies. A significant part of my work involved linking green patent data with scientific publication data to explore how knowledge from science contributes to emerging technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Across three papers, I analysed different aspects of this linkage. The first examines how the extent of scientific citations in patents correlates with their generality and future citation impact. The second investigates how various types of knowledge recombination—such as interdisciplinary and atypical scientific combinations—affect technological outcomes. The third brings in a socio-technical lens, examining how gender homophily among inventors influences the selection of scientific publications cited in green patents.
    </p>
    <p>
        This work contributes to understanding how research and diversity in scientific practices can shape the future of green technology development.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Role: Research Associate</h2>
    <p>
        I worked as a research associate for Prof. Cornelia Lawson and Dr. Xin Deng, where we were building a UK doctoral graduate database. I am interested in exploring how research and science in the UK translate into technological practices and applications (please see:
        <a href="https://www.mioir.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/uk-dgci/">UK DGCI</a>) Our work involves building a longitudinal database of UK doctoral graduates to explore career trajectories, mobility, and contributions to academia and industry. This role allows me to apply my skills in data architecture, API integration, and policy-focused research design.
    </p>

    <h2>Programming & Analytical Skills</h2>
    <p>
        I work primarily in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong> for tasks like data collection, processing, visualization, and modeling. Early in my PhD, I used the Bibliometrix R package to map citation networks, then adopted <code>pybliometrics</code> to retrieve Scopus data via APIs. My core Python stack includes <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>, <code>scipy</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>scikit-image</code>. In R, I frequently use <code>dplyr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code> for data wrangling and visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve taken part in advanced training through <a href="https://www.risis2.eu/">RISIS</a> data workshops, the AI4STIP Winter School (focused on LLMs and NLP), and Andrew Ng’s machine learning course. I also work in a Linux virtual environment to manage data pipelines and metadata infrastructures. Approximately 68% of my current work could be classified as applied data science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learn quickly and adapt to new tools and techniques with ease. Whether modeling knowledge diffusion or building research databases, I enjoy solving complex analytical problems and collaborating with others to generate actionable insights.
    </p>

    <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
    <p>
        During my doctoral training, I gained hands-on teaching experience at the University of Manchester, supporting undergraduate courses in the Department of Computer Science. As a Teaching Assistant for “Database Systems,” I led lab tutorials and provided project support to students working on relational database design and queries.
    </p>
    <p>
        I completed the <strong>AMBS TA Professional Development Workshop Series</strong>, which trained me in key teaching techniques—ranging from public speaking and the use of graphical aids to fostering classroom interaction and providing constructive feedback. I also explored strategies for supporting international students and reflecting on my TA experience to strengthen academic job applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        To improve student engagement, I incorporate digital tools like <strong>Mentimeter</strong>, <strong>Padlet</strong>, <strong>Slido</strong>, and <strong>Poll Everywhere</strong>. These platforms help me create inclusive, interactive sessions that respond to student feedback in real time.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
        My long-term aim is to contribute to high-impact, interdisciplinary research that informs innovation policy and addresses pressing societal challenges. I hope to expand my research into the roles of science and diversity in shaping responsible technologies, continue mentoring students, and contribute to collaborative, international research communities.
