  <h1 style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: bold;">Biography</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 850px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.7; color: #37474f;">
    I am a Research Associate at the University of Manchester’s Alliance Manchester Business School. My academic journey is driven by a deep interest in how science and innovation intersect, especially in green technologies and artificial intelligence. I am committed to research that contributes to real-world impact—through rigorous analysis, collaborative projects, and policy engagement.

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e;">PhD Research</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    My doctoral research at the University of Manchester explored the dynamic link between scientific research and technological innovation, with a specific focus on green technologies. A core aspect of my work involved linking green patent data to scientific publication data to examine how knowledge from science shapes technological development.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    Across three empirical papers, I investigated various dimensions of this science–technology relationship. The first paper demonstrates that green patents citing a greater volume of scientific knowledge tend to be more generalisable and have higher forward citation counts, suggesting broader technological influence. The second paper analyzes how interdisciplinary and atypical combinations of scientific knowledge contribute to the technological impact of green patents, uncovering the effects of knowledge recombination. The third paper incorporates a socio-technical dimension, exploring how gender homophily among green patent inventors influences their choice of cited scientific literature.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    Through this research, I contributed to understanding how scientific knowledge flows into emerging technological domains, and how collaboration and diversity shape innovation outcomes—especially in fields critical to sustainability and climate action.

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Current Role: Research Associate</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I currently work as a Research Associate on the UK Doctoral Graduate Cohort Intelligence (DGCI) project, in collaboration with Professor Cornelia Lawson. Our project is developing a comprehensive database of UK doctoral graduates to support longitudinal research on academic careers and policy impact. This role allows me to combine my interests in science policy, data infrastructure, and large-scale analysis of research ecosystems.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    My current work builds on the foundations of my doctoral training and expands into the operational side of research data management, including API-based data retrieval, metadata curation, and linking structured datasets for longitudinal tracking.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Programming & Analytical Skills</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I have developed robust programming skills through ongoing practice and formal training. My primary tools are <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>, which I use for bibliometric analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and automation. Early in my PhD, I used the Bibliometrix R package to construct citation networks, and later adopted <code>pybliometrics</code> to access Scopus data programmatically.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I participated in <a href="https://www.risis2.eu/" style="color: #1565c0;">RISIS</a> training courses and the AI4STIP Winter School, where I expanded my understanding of <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong> and <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>. These experiences, combined with completing Andrew Ng’s foundational course in machine learning, gave me a solid grasp of statistical modeling and algorithmic theory.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I frequently work in Linux virtual environments to process large-scale metadata and build research databases. About two-thirds of my day-to-day involves tasks typically associated with data science, using libraries such as <code>numpy</code>, <code>scikit-image</code>, <code>scipy</code>, <code>pandas</code>, and <code>matplotlib</code>. In R, I use <code>dplyr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code> for data wrangling and visualization. My strengths lie in data modeling, feature engineering, cleaning and transformation, and in translating technical analysis into meaningful research questions.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I am known for my ability to quickly learn new concepts and tools. I enjoy tackling analytical challenges and collaborating on cross-functional teams to integrate models into practical, high-impact research workflows.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Teaching Experience</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I have experience teaching at the undergraduate level in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where I served as a Teaching Assistant for the “Database Systems” course. I led lab sessions and workshops, supporting students in understanding data modeling, relational databases, and SQL. I also provided guidance on student group projects and assignments, reinforcing the connection between theoretical concepts and applied design.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I completed the <strong>AMBS TA Professional Development Workshop Series</strong>, which covered essential teaching skills such as public speaking, visual communication, and encouraging student feedback. I also learned how to use feedback to improve teaching delivery and how to support students outside the classroom. The training emphasized professional growth through TA work, including how to position it on a CV and use it as a basis for conference presentations or pedagogical research.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I actively incorporate digital tools into my teaching, including <strong>Mentimeter</strong>, <strong>Padlet</strong>, <strong>Slido</strong>, and <strong>Poll Everywhere</strong> to enhance engagement, deliver real-time feedback, and create inclusive, interactive learning environments. These tools help me support international students and encourage broader participation across diverse cohorts.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    My ambition is to continue contributing to interdisciplinary, policy-relevant research that connects the science of innovation with real-world societal challenges. I hope to publish further on topics at the intersection of green technology, science policy, and data-driven research methods. I’m equally excited about opportunities in collaborative research, mentoring, and educational development, where I can bridge technical and social dimensions of innovation.
