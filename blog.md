  <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #f8c1cc; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.8;">
    I train as a doctoral researcher at the University of Manchester's Alliance Manchester Business School, where I am interested in the knowledge production and exchange in emerging technology areas such as green technologies and AI. At the same time, I worked as a research assistant for Prof. Cornelia Lawson, where we were building a UK doctoral graduate database. I am interested in exploring how research and science in the UK translate into technological practices and applications (please see: 
    <a href="https://www.mioir.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/uk-dgci/" style="color: #3498db;">UK DGCI</a>).
    
    My work has mostly focused on green technologies—where the diversity of components and uncertainties raises questions about how to better develop them through the synergy between science, technology, and collaboration among various actors in research networks. I am also interested in knowledge flows and production in critical technologies such as AI and its applications.

  <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #fbe7a1; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.8;">
    The linkages between science and technology hold significant promise for important emerging fields, such as AI and green technologies, which shape how we address grand societal challenges. 
    
    I study how the interaction between science and technology manifests in emerging and green technologies to answer questions about how science shapes green technologies within the context of the interactions and dynamics between the evolving science and technology landscapes. 
    
    Along with contemporary shifts in science, such as Mode 2 knowledge production, characterized by interdisciplinary research exchange and disruptive knowledge trajectories, I explore how these phenomena foster subsequent innovations. Slowly and surely, I am building momentum for more research and projects around the nexus between science, technology, and innovation policy.

  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #f8c1cc; margin-top: 40px;">General Research Interests</h2>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #f8c1cc; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.8;">
    My research follows the theme of innovation and knowledge production, exploring complex relationships between science and technology and their intersection with policy implications and policymaking. 

    Through research into bibliometric data such as patents and publications, I have some ongoing working papers. For instance, one explores how the use of science affects the development of green technologies, demonstrating how science impacts green patent citations and influence. 

    I enjoy learning programming and novel methods, such as machine learning and semantic similarity. I’m passionate about sustainability in addressing environmental change and exploring evolving government policies to promote a green future.

  <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #fbe7a1; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.8;">
    During my PhD in 2023, I had minimal teaching commitments with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. I worked closely with Dr. Gareth Henshall’s team to deliver courses, workshops, and labs on Database Systems. I also assisted undergraduate student groups with their projects and assignments on database design.
