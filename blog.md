  <h1 style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: bold;">Biography</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 850px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.7; color: #37474f;">
    I am a Research Associate at the University of Manchester’s Alliance Manchester Business School. My academic journey has been driven by a curiosity about how science, technology, and innovation intersect to shape societal outcomes—particularly in areas like green technologies and artificial intelligence. I’m passionate about translating complex research into real-world impact through collaboration, policy, and data-driven insights.

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e;">Research & Academic Journey</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I earned my doctoral training at the University of Manchester, where my research focused on the role of science in emerging technological domains—especially within green innovation. I have investigated how scientific knowledge contributes to innovation trajectories, uncovering the dynamics of interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge flow. My PhD was embedded in the <a href="https://www.mioir.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/uk-dgci/" style="color: #1565c0;">UK Doctoral Graduate Cohort Intelligence (DGCI)</a> project. As part of this initiative, I worked with Professor Cornelia Lawson to construct a national doctoral database that informs science and technology policy development.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    Today, as a Research Associate, I continue to explore how research ecosystems foster innovation in green and AI technologies. My work seeks to map the evolving interplay between science and technology through methods such as bibliometric analysis and network mapping.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Programming & Analytical Skills</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I have developed a strong programming skillset through continuous training and hands-on data work. My primary tools are <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, which I use for data retrieval, analysis, and visualization. Early in my doctoral journey, I leveraged R and the Bibliometrix package to construct citation networks and trace scholarly impact. Over time, I incorporated Python tools like <code>pybliometrics</code> to automate the retrieval of Scopus data via APIs.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    My learning has been enriched by training programs such as the <a href="https://www.risis2.eu/" style="color: #1565c0;">RISIS</a> data infrastructure workshops and the AI4STIP Winter School, where I deepened my understanding of <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>, and semantic similarity techniques. I have also engaged with Andrew Ng’s machine learning curriculum to strengthen my knowledge of algorithmic theory and predictive modeling.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    My typical workflow involves Linux-based virtual environments, where I build data architectures for scalable analysis and prediction. I use libraries such as <code>numpy</code>, <code>scipy</code>, <code>scikit-image</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>pandas</code>. About 68% of my daily work could be categorized as applied data science. I also work with R libraries like <code>dplyr</code> for data wrangling and <code>ggplot2</code> for data visualization. My core skills include data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation—essential for bridging scientific insights with real-world applications.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I take pride in my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to evolving methodologies. I enjoy tackling technical challenges and collaborating across disciplines to integrate models into viable solutions.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Teaching Experience</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    As part of my academic career, I have supported undergraduate teaching in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Database Systems course. I delivered lab sessions, supported student projects, and guided learners through the fundamentals of relational databases and SQL design. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of pedagogy, communication, and instructional design.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    To enhance my teaching capabilities, I completed the <strong>AMBS TA Professional Development Workshop Series</strong>. This training covered public speaking, classroom engagement, feedback strategies, and techniques to support international students. I learned how to apply digital tools like <strong>Mentimeter</strong>, <strong>Padlet</strong>, <strong>Poll Everywhere</strong>, and <strong>Slido</strong> to enhance interactivity and encourage student participation. These tools have helped me develop engaging, responsive teaching methods that adapt to diverse classroom needs.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    These experiences have shown me how teaching not only supports student learning but also shapes one’s academic identity. I aim to contribute to pedagogy-driven research and publish in the future on topics related to digital engagement and inclusive education.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #1a237e; margin-top: 40px;">Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    I hope to continue contributing to impactful, policy-relevant research at the intersection of science and society. My goal is to publish high-quality academic work, build collaborative networks, and bridge analytical expertise with policy discourse. Whether through teaching, programming, or empirical research, I seek to make sense of complexity—and help others do the same.
