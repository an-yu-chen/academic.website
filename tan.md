# My Life-Changing Journey in Tanzania

In Tanzania,this journey reminded me that we are all connected. Having purity in heart and positive attitudes made a significant difference. And being kind is not optional — it is essential.

Whilst there, I was involved in helping with computer teaching, setting up computer classrooms, and engaging in cultural exchange.  
This trip changed my life entirely — it taught me to see the light, to always appreciate, and to be willing to help as much as I can.  

There were so many moments of laughter, singing, and heartwarming connection. God reminded me again and again to be gentle and live in the moment, and I am deeply grateful for that. I am very thankful for everyone I met here.

I also had the chance to learn Kiswahili and experience the feelings of moving to another country. It was not always easy, but this experience made me independent and showed me the ways of building my life in a place that was completely new to me.

The joy of knowing that life, with all its unknowns, always finds its way gave me peace.
